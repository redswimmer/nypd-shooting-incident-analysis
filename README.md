# Project Overview

In this project I will be analyzing historic NYPD shooting data from 2006 to 2023. The shooting data comes from the five boroughs of New York City: Manhattan, Brooklyn, Queens, the Bronx, and Staten Island. My goal is to identify any underlying trends in the data that help better understand the shooting activity varies by borough.

## Data Source

The data was obtained from the [NYC Open Data](https://data.cityofnewyork.us/api/views/833y-fsy8/rows.csv) website. The data is updated daily and includes information on the date, time, location, and outcome of each shooting incident.

## Setup

To run this project is built in R and requires the following packages:

-   dplyr
-   ggplot2
-   lubridate
-   corrplot
